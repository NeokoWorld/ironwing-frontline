    histoire: |
      Kieran graduated from the Solanian Aeronaval Academy at the age of 23. His first deployment sent him into the heart of Ansium’s civil conflict in late 2013.
      
      While stationed on an airbase under Solanian control, he uncovered a dark truth: an extremist faction within the Solanian government and military was constructing a massive orbital laser platform, codenamed **HYPERION**. Its intended purpose was nothing short of genocide—targeting the Pro-Azura population of Ansium.
      
      Faced with a moral crossroads, Kieran made a drastic choice. Under the cover of night, he stole the experimental VF-27 prototype stationed at his base and defected. Seeking to stop the impending atrocity, he joined the rogue resistance group Chimera.
      
      Together, they launched a covert campaign against HYPERION. Against all odds, Kieran and Chimera succeeded in destroying the orbital weapon, effectively forcing Solana to withdraw from the war.
      
      As a result, Kieran—once labeled a traitor—was hailed as a hero by the international community. Doria and Talan offered Chimera amnesty and invited them to form the first peacekeeping squadron of the newly founded World Movement for Peace (WMP): the Phoenix Squadron.
      
      Kieran accepted the offer, gaining political immunity from Solana's prosecution. To this day, opinions remain divided—some see him as a deserter, others as the man who prevented a massacre.

      Kieran is known among his peers by the callsign Kestrel, earned for his sharp reflexes and affinity for high-altitude interception missions. Despite his reputation as a skilled pilot, he tends to get nervous before big operations, often relying on a small blue ribbon he keeps in his flight suit pocket for luck. 
      
      Outside of combat, he is surprisingly talkative and enjoys discussing aircraft engineering. His VF-27 remains one of the few prototypes ever stolen successfully from a Solanian facility. He has a habit of doodling aircraft silhouettes in mission briefings and has an extensive collection of naval model ships he builds during downtime.
      
      Although he has been offered citizenship in both Doria and Talan, he still considers himself Solanian at heart, despite being officially exiled. His Phoenix Squadron helmet is decorated with a stylized blue kestrel in flight, a personal emblem that became symbolic of his defection and later redemption.
