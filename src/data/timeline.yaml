  - title: "1st Solar Isles Crisis"
    years: "1992"
    summary: >
      A major diplomatic conflict opposed Solana and Talan, who claimed surveillance rights over the Solar Isles for “global energy security.” Doria acted as arbitrator, and a treaty signed in Doria prevented escalation but created a chill between Talan and Solana since.

      The Azura Empire attempts a covert operation to infiltrate, control, and annex the Solar Isles under the pretext of securing their energy resources.

      Failed attempt to create an independent supranational military organization, signed by Solana, Doria, and some allies. Azura, Talan, and their spheres of influence boycotted the agreement. The failure justified the rise of independent mercenarism.
    consequences:
      - Sylvaria becomes a neutral mercenary “sanctuary,” outside state control.
      - Failure of the accords triggers an explosion of **independent aerial mercenarism**.

  - title: "Chimera Actions"
    years: "2011–2014"
